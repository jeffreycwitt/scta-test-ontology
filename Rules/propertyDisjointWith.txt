This is rule 1. We intend this rule to check the consitity of our test ontology.
It will test, if there are any Individuals that are conected to each other more than ones AND
by properties that are owl:propertyDisjointWith.
We expect, that the result will be zero.

THIS IS THE SPARQL-QUERY:


PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX sctar: <http://www.scta.info/resource/>
PREFIX sctap: <http://www.scta.info/property/>


SELECT ?S ?P ?P2 ?O
WHERE {
  ?P owl:propertyDisjointWith ?P2.
  ?S ?P ?O.
  ?S ?P2 ?O.

}
LIMIT 25
