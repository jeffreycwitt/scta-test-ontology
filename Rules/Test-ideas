This document is a list of all owl-Properties that might be an inspiration for the creation of more consistancy-checks.
They might be discussed and may get their own rule-docuement after it.

owl:equivalentProperty rdf:range rdf:Property, rdf:domain rdf:Property,
is NOT used for properties that are equal,
but for properties that have the same values with a different meaning anyway.
 We might ask for every Property that is stated as equivalent to another,
 we would expect no results.
SELECT ?h
?p rdf:range ?x; rdf:domaine ?y.
?x, ?y a rdf:Property.
?h rdf:range ?x; rdf:domaine ?y. OR: ?h = ?p. [?]

owl:inverseOf
We might like to test if any Property does not have an inverse Property.
SELECT ?p ?p2
?p NOT owl:inverseOf ?p2.
?p2 rdf:domaine ?O.
