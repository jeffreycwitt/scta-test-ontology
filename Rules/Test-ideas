This document is a list of all owl-Properties that might be an inspiration for the creation of more consistancy-checks.
They might be discussed and may get their own rule-docuement after it.

owl:equivalentProperty
  rdf:range rdf:Property, rdf:domain rdf:Property,
  is NOT used for properties that are equal,
  but for properties that have the same values with a different meaning anyway.
  We might ask for every Property that is stated as equivalent to another,
  we would expect no results.

SELECT ?h
WHERE {
?p rdf:range ?x; rdf:domaine ?y.
?x, ?y a rdf:Property.
?h rdf:range ?x; rdf:domaine ?y. OR: ?h = ?p. [?]
}


owl:inverseOf
  We might like to test if any Property does not have an inverse Property.
  We would expect that every Property has one that is inverse of to it.
  Therefore, the result should be zero.

SELECT ?p ?p2 ?p3 ?s ?o
WHERE {
?p owl:inverseOf ?p2.
?s ?p ?o.
?s ?p2 ?o.
?s ?p3 ?o.

FILTER(?p3 != ?p)
}
