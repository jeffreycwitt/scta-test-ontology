This is to test for disjoint Classes.
In the logic of owl, an individual can be a member of several classes.
But sometimes, we want to say that one individual is the member of class1
and THEREFORE can not be member of class2.
In this case, we might want to state two classes as disjointClasses.

SELECT ?S ?S2 ?P ?O
WHERE {
?S owl:disjointClasses ?S2 .
?S ?P ?O .
?S2 ?P ?O .
}

QUESTION: THIS WOULD ONLY WORK OUT IF WE WOULD HAVE MARKED AT LEAST TWO CLASSES
AS DISJOINT IN OUR DATE. DID WE?
